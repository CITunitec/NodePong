# PONG

With Node.js, Express, Stylus, Socket.io and jQuery

Try it online thanks to [Nodejitsu](http://nodejitsu.com/): [Pong Online](http://sadasant.pong.jit.su/).

Small advertising: Nodejitsu is the best Node PaaS EVER.

## How to run it

Download the sources:

    git clone git@github.com:CITUnitec/NodePong.git;

Get yourself into the NodePong folder, then:

    npm install

To install the dependencies, then run it with **node**:

    node app.js

And finally go to: <http://localhost:3000>

You'll need at least two browsers tabs to play, or two browsers, or two
computers in the same network, or a remote server.
