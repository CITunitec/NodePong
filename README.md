# PONG

With Node.js, Express, Stylus, Socket.io and jQuery

## How to run it

Download the sources:

    git clone git@github.com:CITUnitec/NodePong.git;

Get yourself into the NodePong folder, then:

    npm install

To install the dependencies, and finally go to: <http://localhost:3000>

You'll need at least two browsers tabs to play, or two browsers, or two
computers in the same network, or a remote server (if you do, please
let me know).
